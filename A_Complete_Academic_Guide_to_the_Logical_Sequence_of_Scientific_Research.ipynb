        "\n",
        "Scientific inquiry begins with **deep immersion in specialized literature** within the researcher’s field. This foundational phase involves developing an informed understanding of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Theoretical frameworks, paradigms, and disciplinary debates;\n",
        "- Empirical trends and methodological patterns;\n",
        "- Seminal studies and current research gaps.\n",

        "\n",
        "Researchers should analyze methodologies, detect inconsistencies, and identify **gaps** where their contribution can advance knowledge. This stage transforms reading into **active analytical engagement**.\n",

        "A **research problem** defines the intellectual and empirical focus of the study. It must be:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Relevant** — addresses a meaningful knowledge gap;\n",
        "2. **Feasible** — can be investigated within practical constraints;\n",
        "3. **Original** — adds new insight or perspective to existing knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
